Preprocess.py // the file that takes the raw blockchain data from GETH. It

TxnGraph.py // this takes the mongo database and creates a "snapshot" which
is/contains a graph. From that you can "draw" transaction graphs and run
something called extract.py (see below)

extract.py // converts transaction graph object to .csv flat file. It uses
parsedblocks.py.

transaction ammounts, # of transactions, # of addresses in/out, # of P2P, mean
and standard deviation across addresses
